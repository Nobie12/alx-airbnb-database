# SQL Joins Queries

This repository contains SQL queries demonstrating different types of joins, focusing on **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, and **FULL OUTER JOIN**. The objective is to master SQL joins by writing complex queries that retrieve data from multiple related tables.

## üéØ Objective

Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.

---

## üìÑ Instructions

The `joins_queries.sql` file contains the following queries:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN

**Query Description:**  
Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings. This join will only return rows where there is a match in both the `bookings` table and the `users` table.

```sql
-- Query 1: INNER JOIN - Retrieve all bookings and the respective users
SELECT 
  b.booking_id,
  b.property_id,
  b.check_in_date,
  b.check_out_date,
  u.user_id,
  u.username,
  u.email
FROM bookings AS b
INNER JOIN users AS u ON b.user_id = u.user_id;
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN

**Query Description:**  
Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews. This join will return all rows from the `properties` table (left table) and the matching rows from the `reviews` table. If there is no match, `NULL` values will appear for columns from the `reviews` table.

```sql
-- Query 2: LEFT JOIN - Retrieve all properties and their reviews (including properties with no reviews)
SELECT 
  p.property_id,
  p.property_name,
  p.location,
  r.review_id,
  r.rating,
  r.comment
FROM properties AS p
LEFT JOIN reviews AS r ON p.property_id = r.property_id;
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN

**Query Description:**  
Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user. This join will return all rows from both the `users` table and the `bookings` table. Where there is no match, `NULL` values will appear for columns from the non-matching table.

> **Note:** Not all SQL engines support `FULL OUTER JOIN` directly. If your SQL environment does not support it, you can use a `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` to achieve the same result.

---

### ‚úÖ FULL OUTER JOIN (If Supported)

```sql
-- Query 3: FULL OUTER JOIN - Retrieve all users and all bookings (including unmatched)
SELECT 
  u.user_id,
  u.username,
  u.email,
  b.booking_id,
  b.property_id,
  b.check_in_date,
  b.check_out_date
FROM users AS u
FULL OUTER JOIN bookings AS b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
```

### ‚úÖ Alternative Using UNION (For Engines like MySQL)

```sql
-- Alternative FULL OUTER JOIN using UNION of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN
SELECT 
  u.user_id,
  u.username,
  u.email,
  b.booking_id,
  b.property_id,
  b.check_in_date,
  b.check_out_date
FROM users AS u
LEFT JOIN bookings AS b ON u.user_id = b.user_id

UNION

SELECT 
  u.user_id,
  u.username,
  u.email,
  b.booking_id,
  b.property_id,
  b.check_in_date,
  b.check_out_date
FROM users AS u
RIGHT JOIN bookings AS b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
```
